# Postcard

We'll make it possible for a postcard designer to send multiple postcards at once. To accomplish so, the server will save all of the postcard data in a database. Each postcard will have a unique URL, allowing each recipient to see something unique.

The postcard app will be similar to the other apps in terms of usability. When the creator clicks the "share postcard" button, a pop-up appears with a link for the receiver to access the new postcard. The creator can copy this link and paste it into an email, text, or social media post to share the postcard with a friend.
